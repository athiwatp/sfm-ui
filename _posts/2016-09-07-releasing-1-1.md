In between summer vacations and [public transit hurdles](https://web.archive.org/web/20160907133810/http://www.wmata.com/rail/safetrack.cfm), we've cranked out 
release version 1.1 of [Social Feed Manager](http://sfm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 

While a number of changes were made in this release, three in particular are 
worth drawing your attention to:

* Added support for harvesting and exporting [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com).
  For those of you keeping count, this is the final social media platform 
  called for by our grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission. 
  (Sidenote: SFM is made to be extensible for other social media platforms. 
  If you have interest in adding an additional platform, let's talk.)
* Significant performance improvements to extracting social media data 
  from WARCs. (By significant, I mean 10X. You'll be thankful when
  you're processing millions of tweets.)
* Significant refactoring to Docker configuration. This will make deployments 
  easier, with most configuration performed in a .env properties file. 
  Documentation for both production deployment and development has been 
  updated to reflect the changes. (Not familiar with Docker? No problem.
  We've tried to write the documentation for Docker newbies. Let us know
  where it needs more work.)
  
Thanks to Jason Casden (NCSU Libraries) for useful feedback on our deployment
process. And the performance improvement work stemmed from our participation
in [Archives Unleashed 2.0](http://archivesunleashed.com/) early in the summer.
